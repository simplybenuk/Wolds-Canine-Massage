        <h1>Information for Veterinary Professionals</h1>
        <p>Canine massage can be beneficial in multiple musculoskeletal conditions, and can improve pain control and mobility. As a non-invasive therapy
            it can work well alongside many conventional treatments.</p>
        <p>Wolds Canine Massage is keen to work alongside veterinary practices to optimise outcomes for dogs and their owners.</p>
        <p>As per the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/36" target="_blank">Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966</a>, we will request veterinary consent forms before appointments. If during any massage it is deemed that a
              Veterinarian should be consulted for investigation / diagnosis then the owner will be informed and this will be detailed in the report to the referring vet.</p>
