      <h2>Phototherapy treatment</h2>
      <p><strong>Optimus Lumia</strong></p>
      <p>Olivia is excited to be working with Optimus Therapy Tech as a 2024 ambassador.</p>
      <p>The Optimus Lumia delivers red and blue light therapy and is a non-invasive treatment to support healing and reduce infection. It will now be available to use during your dog's massage therapy sessions.</p>
      <p>The Optimus Lumina is proven to relax muscle tension and spasms which relieves pain, inflammation and chronic conditions such as arthritis and overuse injuries. Using the device gives pain relief through red light therapy releasing endorphins (the body’s natural pain killing chemicals) and serotonin (the key chemical for stabilising mood and enhancing feelings of wellbeing). 
        Blue light therapy has a damaging biochemical effect on bacterial cells that causes them to die.</p>
      <p>The device is simple for you to use at home and great for maintaining your dog between sessions.</p>
      <p>Unlock the full potential of innovative therapy technology by securing your very own device today. Visit <a href="https://www.optimustherapytech.com/">Optimus Therapy Tech</a> to purchase your very own Optimus Lumia.

      <p>As a special offer, Wolds Canine Massage are delighted to offer you an exclusive £25 discount on your purchase. Simply enter the promotional code <strong>WOLDS25</strong> at checkout to enjoy this special savings.</p>

      <p>Olivia works according to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 and Exemptions Order 2015.  Owners must always consult their Veterinary Surgeon before seeking massage treatment. Healthy dogs do not always require a veterinary referral for maintenance care,
        however, all dogs must be registered with a veterinary surgeon. Olivia will always refer a dog to their vet should there be any indication of underlying health issues.</p>
