      <p>If your dog is insured many pet insurers will cover the cost of complimentary therapy for your dog if they have been referred for treatment by a veterinary surgeon. Please discuss this with your insurance company prior to your appointment if required. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Olivia works according to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 and Exemptions Order 2015.  Owners must always consult their Veterinary Surgeon before seeking massage treatment. Healthy dogs do not always require a veterinary referral for maintenance care,
        however, all dogs must be registered with a veterinary surgeon. Olivia will always refer a dog to their vet should there be any indication of underlying health issues.</p>
