        <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h3>Why does my dog need a massage?</h3>
        <p>Canine massage therapy can help to improve your dog’s mobility, recovery from injury and performance. Massage techniques are used to reduce muscular pain and inflammation and promote relaxation. Massage can help to alleviate pain from many musculoskeletal conditions, help to prevent further injury and to reduce tension in anxious dogs. For sporting and working dogs massage can help to optimise performance and reduce the risk of injury. As a non-invasive therapy it works well alongside other veterinary care. Targeted exercise plans and lifestyle changes can be recommended to support your dog.</p>

        <h3>What happens during an appointment?</h3>
        <p>Before your session I will have been in contact to discuss you and your dog’s requirements, concerns and medical history and to discuss veterinary consent.</p>
        <p>Please ensure that your dog has not had a meal for 2 hours prior to your appointment.</p>
        <p>Initial appointments are usually 1.5 hours. After arriving we will usually take some time to observe your dog and discuss any concerns and expectations for the session. I will take a complete history of your dog’s lifestyle, behaviour and activity at home - owners are fantastic at giving lots of information about how their dog is feeling!</p>
        <p>During the first appointment I will conduct static and dynamic evaluation, looking at your dog’s gait and posture. I will use hands on palpation to assess your dog’s muscles and follow with a full body massage which is tailored to the needs of your dog. If appropriate I will also use photizo vetcare red light therapy during the session. You are very welcome to stay with your dog for the duration of the session. I will usually assess and massage your dog on the floor using our large comfortable massage pad. However there is the option to use a massage table if your dog prefers.</p>
        <p>At the end of the session I will give you aftercare advice and we can also discuss lifestyle changes and rehabilitation exercises which may benefit your dog.</p>
        <p>Your dog may feel more tired after their session and should have short, on the lead, walks only for the next day to avoid strenuous exercise. They may feel more thirsty following and need to urinate more. These symptoms are normal for 24-48 hours following massage.</p>

        <h3>What is photizo vetcare?</h3>
        <p>Photizo Vetcare uses LED therapy as a non-invasive treatment tool to accelerate natural healing and provide drug free pain management for degenerative conditions - available to add on if appropriate during your dogs treatment.</p>

        <h3>What if my dog won’t stay still for a massage!</h3>
        <p>This is not a problem at all! Dogs often like to move around during sessions or have short breaks. Most dogs will lie down and relax during the massage as we work with the parasympathetic nervous system, responsible for ‘rest and digest’. The session will be completely tailored to your dog’s needs.</p>

        <h3>What happens after an appointment?</h3>
        <p>In the days following your appointment I will contact you to follow up how you feel your dog has responded to the massage and to ensure that you do not have any concerns.</p>
        <p>I will also send a report of your dog’s session to your vet to ensure that there is good communication with the veterinary team.</p>

        <h3>How many appointments will my dog need?</h3>
        <p>During your first session we will discuss your dog’s needs and recommended therapy plan. This will vary depending on each individual dog. 1-3 sessions usually show the best effects, however many dogs benefit from monthly maintenance sessions depending on their conditions.</p>

        <h3>Why do I need a veterinary referral?</h3>
        <p>Canine Massage therapists must work according to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 and Exemptions Order 2015. Owners must always consult their Veterinary Surgeon before seeking massage treatment. Healthy dogs do not always require a veterinary referral for maintenance care, however, all dogs must be registered with a veterinary surgeon. I will always refer a dog back to their vet should there be any indication of underlying health issues.</p>
        <p>I am happy to liaise with your vets on your behalf to obtain consent for your dog.</p>

        <h3>Is massage therapy covered by my pet insurance?</h3>
        <p>Many insurance policies now include cover for complementary therapies such as canine massage. Please speak with your own insurer prior to your appointment if you would like to find out if the cost of your sessions will be covered.</p>

        <h3>Where do appointments take place?</h3>
        <p>Appointments are usually held at our relaxing clinic room in Spilsby, creating a calm environment for your dog. Home visits are available if preferred, however may incur a mileage charge depending on location. Please contact me to discuss your requirements.</p>

        <h3>When might massage not be suitable for my dog?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A lame dog who has not been seen by a vet</li>
            <li>Open wounds</li>
            <li>If the dog is in shock or suffering from exhaustion</li>
            <li>If the dog has a fever or virus</li>
            <li>Diarrhoea or vomiting</li>
            <li>Pregnancy</li>
            <li>Skin infections</li>
            <li>Cancer</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Can you diagnose my dog’s health condition or injury?</h3>
        <p>Only vets are able to diagnose health conditions or injuries in your dog. If I have any concerns during your dog's assessment I will recommend that you make an appointment with your vet and can send a report detailing any findings or concerns.</p>
